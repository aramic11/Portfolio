# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description
I needed to make a portfolio so I could showcase my projects and tell future employers a little bit about myself. I plan on adding more projects to my portfolio in the future and I cant wait to enhance my coding skills. I learned quite a lot with this portfolio. It allowed me to create something that is a bit more eyecatching and I learned many things such as hovering over something and having it enhance, connecting icons/pics with links and making it accessible for both mobile and web users. It was a fun project but I cant wait to add even more to my portfolio so it could look better and be more interactive.
